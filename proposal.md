# CS6120 Final Project Proposal 

We will implement a LLVM frontend implementation for the programming language `awk`. `awk` is a scripting language used to process text, and is a standard utility feature in many operating systems.

// To do so, we will...

Our evaluation will include a test suite to increase confidence in our implementation. Additionally, we will compare our implementation with other existing compiler implementations of `awk`-like languages, including [lawk](http://lawk.sourceforge.net/) and [frawk](https://github.com/ezrosent/frawk), both in terms of language features we support and also in terms of runtime.
